This folder contains some information on using the Narrative Language.

- The formal syntax can be found in the grammar.pdf.
- The files enzymatic.nl and mapk.nl are two examples of small models. The former has
  some explanatory comments on the syntax.
  
- The code in this repository differs from the official version by the inclusion of the
  uk.ac.ed.inf.biopepa.ui.wizards.importing package and an updated plugin.xml file. These
  provide the interface for the NL -> BioPEPA translation from within the BioPEPA plugin.
  Our intention is for this to be included in the next major release of the plugin.

- The full code for the translation can be found in narrlang.jar, which is included
  in the updated uk.ac.ed.inf.biopepa.ui. This includesthe Xtext grammar file,
  the classes generated automatically by Xtext and the classes that implement the
  translation. We strongly suggest the use of the plugin insteadof the "standalone"
  version, as it allows for easier use and better display of errors.If needed,
  however, the main way to call the translator is by running MainClass:
  
  java MainClass <input-filename> <input-location> <output-location>
  
  (Note, however, Eclipse might not be happy with files located outside the
  project's folder, and Windows users might need to use "//" as separator
  between folders)
  
  This will create a BioPEPA file in output-location (which can be the same as
  input-location), the name of which is the input file's name followed by
  "_out.biopepa".
  
  Using the wizard in the plugin avoids these issues.
